## v0.4.1 (2023-07-06)
* updated examples to use info_span! and match casing of lambda power tools
* fixed metrics dependency to 0.21.1

## v0.4.0 (2023-07-02)

* added Builder::lambda_cold_start_span() for tracking cold starts in traces
* added Collector::write_single() for writing a single metric
* Builder::lambda_cold_start_metric() now calls into Collector::flush_single() under the hood
* removed Collector::flush_to, Collector::flush inputs std::io::Write 
* replaced Collector::flush_to_with_timestamp with Builder::with_timestamp
* reduced memory allocations in Collector::flush() by replacing a couple single element vectors with arrays
* eliminated a string copy on metrics::describe_*
